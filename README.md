# Random Person Number

A Kotlin multiplatform app that randomizes a possible Swedish person number based on age and gender. It compiles for Android, iOS and Javacript. https://github.com/joreilly/PeopleInSpace was used as a starting point for this project and some code from there could still be found here.
